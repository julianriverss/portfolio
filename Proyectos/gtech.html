									<p>When I worked for Gtech.Systems, they hadn’t implemented Google Analytics, 
										GTA, or Google Search Console, they wanted to increase their visibility 
										and boost their sales. They wanted to activate their Instagram account 
										because it was abandoned. I made a global content strategy that implies 
										Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Google, Email marketing automation, and 
										YouTube by creating content evergreen to optimize the time to create 
										content and at the same time share valuable content for the followers 
										on the different platforms which give to the company a huge reach and 
										increase the sales when they made a launch for a new product or for holy days.</p>
									<p>On Instagram, I made a strategy that let the Instagram account reach up to 11.000 
										people just with organic content on their Instagram stories which is a lot compared
										 to 300 people when they only uploaded sales content to their stories. </p>
										 <p> I made a report where they can look at the global metrics on Looker Studio before 
											called Google Data Studio. </p>
											<p> The landing page for Black Friday is a landing page built in February which is
												 optimized to rank for keywords related to the products that the company sells
												  and for Black Friday. The important thing here is that the company will offer
												   the products and big promotions on this landing page, but they are going to blur
												    the prices, also they are going to let a form for those who would like to buy the
													 product. Google is going to rank this landing page during the whole year and 2 weeks
													  before Black Friday the company will unlock its products and promotions, and, they will
													   make an email marketing campaign for those who are registered on the form.  Doing this
													    is a huge advantage referring to the competition because most of the companies don’t
														 know this strategy and is easy to keep updated this is going to work for years.</p>
